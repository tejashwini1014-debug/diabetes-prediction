# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health-related parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

##  Dataset
The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which is available from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##  Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Model Training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Test Prediction
